	<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>

		<h1>Challenges</h1>
				<p>This lab was not too challenging, however I struggled to fix a problem that I wasn't able to solve when I was doing Lab 13 originally.</p>

		<h1>Results</h1>
				<p></p>


		<h1>Debugging</h1>
				<p>Labs 1-6 were all functioning well</p>
				<p>Lab 7 had an issue with the letter organizer. When putting in a full name using capital letters, the sorting function
				would seperate the upper and lower case letters before organizing them. To fix this I had the function convert the name string into
			all lower case before sorting them.</p>

				Labs 8 & 9 seemed clean. But lab 10 had a similar problem to lab 7:</p>

				<p>Labs 11 & 12 worked really well, whereas lab 13 seemed to function but the interface was rather sloppy. Unfortuantely,
					Not really understanding what the desired input was expected I had a hard time cleaning it to make it look nicer.</p>
