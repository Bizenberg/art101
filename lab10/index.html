			<h1>Lab 10 - JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>Overall this lab was not too challenging. At first, after looking at Profesor Wes's Lab 10 I had thought we needed to randomize the letters in the word entered.
			but once I realized that wasn't a requirement I had an easier time replicating lab 7.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>My biggest problem which I was unable to solve is why my output is showing below the HTML doccument. I trie replicating my partners HTML structure and changing around the Divs but I couldn't get it in the right place.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
