	<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>

		<h1>Challenges</h1>
				<p>Finding an API URL that was still functioning and free took a lot of effort.</p>


		<h1>Problems</h1>
				<p>Many of the API's that claimed to be free were either discontinued or locked behind a key that I could not figure out how to implement.
				Eventually, after enough searching my partner was able to find functioning links.
			Ocasionally the photos in the API we chose are missing, so if the photograph does not appear please try again! </p>
