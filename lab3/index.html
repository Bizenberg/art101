	<h1>Lab 3: File Structures & File Transfers</h1>
		<p>The goal of this lab was to organize file structures on my system and add index.html files to each lab.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I encoutered a lot of challenges during this assignment. Firstly I accidentaly deleted my art101 file attempting to rename it
			I then ran into issues getting my selfie to appear which turned out to be a misspelling of the file name.
			Overall I overcame these issues but still find it challenging to keep my files organized and easily locate and move images. </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here is the file structure:</p>
		<img id="structures" src="img/structures.png" width=200px>
		<p>...and the HTML for this very page:</p>
		<img id="HTML Page" src="img/lab3html.png" width=850>
		<p>This is what the site looks like published using Github!</p>
		<img id="githubsite" src="img/site-published.png" width=850>
		<p>...and now how the files look in Github:</p>
		<img src="img/githubchanges.png" width=850>
		<p>Lastly the HTML and CSS data for Lab 3</p>
