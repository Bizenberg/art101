	<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions & Callbacks</h1>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>It was tricky figuring out how to begin identifying the array in the console, but once that was complete. Transfering from the console to the JS file was easy.
		The difficulty came in trying to display the script on the webpage. </p>

	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>Going off of the code Professor Modes gave us came up with kept coming back in error saying that the mapResults was undefined. It took a long time to figure out that we needed to change the names of the results from each section,
		include more divs with differently labeled divs, and finally add differently numbered output.Els. </p>


	<h2>Results</h2>

  <div id="output"></div>
	<div id="output2"></div>
	<div id="output3"></div>
