			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My first challenges came from just mistyping code. Leaving out some ()s and ""s. These problems were easily solved at further inspection</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>The biggest issue like I mentioned was trying to find where I had typos in the code. To solve this my partner gave me the idea of using the console on inspect of my homepage
				to read the errors. This provided me the insight to see where I had errors and fix them easily. Another problem I had was that the sort algorithm was
				seperate upper case and lower case and sorting them seperately. This gave an innacurate sort because it was not alphabetical. I solved this by first converting the string
				into all lower case and sorting from there.
