		<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<p>My greatest challenge during this assignment was figuring out how to hide the comments once implemented into html.
				I solved this problem using the commands using <,!, and --, and closing with "-->". It was also tricky trying to figure out the Teletype system to work side-by-side my partner.
			</p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
			<p>Overall I encountered very few problems during this assignment. I found it to be quite straightforward. However; im still unsure if I placed the HTML pseudocode in the right place.</p>
