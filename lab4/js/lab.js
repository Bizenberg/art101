  //Pseudocoding the card game War (with gambling)
		//1. randomly select a card for the player and for the computer before each round.
		//2. Accept user input of amount they would like to bet, or deciding to fold.
			//if the player chooses to fold, reset the board
		//3. Computer calls after a certain card threshold.
			//more advanced systems can choose to call based on card value and the amount the player has bet
		//4. test of win or lose condition.
		//5. repeat from step 1.
