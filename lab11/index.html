		<h1>Challenges</h1>

				<p>For the most part this Lab was not too difficult. Section today was very helpful
				in figuring out how to go about using the Jquery.</p>

 <div id="problem" class="sectionbox">
		<h1>Problems</h1>

				<p>The biggest problem was that the button would not work despite having the correct JS code.
				There were no errors. My partner discovered that if both properties had colors identified in the css
			file, the JS would not change it. It was an easy fix.</p>

 <div id="results" class="sectionbox">
		<h1>Results</h1>

				<p>Press the buttons!</p>
